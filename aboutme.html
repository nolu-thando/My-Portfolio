            Hey! My name is Noluthando Mphande and I am a junior Software Developer with a passion for 
            building user-friendly and innovative solutions. I am excited to share my experiences and my journey with you.

            Let me give you a little insight on my background. I am the first born child at home and I think it is important to
            mention this because through my siblings I have learnt to be a good communicator, team leader and a good team player.
            Besides that, theres more to just being the first born child.  
        </p>

            As a junior software developer, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, from mobile applictaions
            to web developments. My journey in software development began with being curious. They curiosity once killed a cat.
            In this case, I might be the cat because I was curious how things work. This led me to explore the world of coding.
